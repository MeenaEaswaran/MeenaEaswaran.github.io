    - Managed transgenic mice colonies, overseeing breeding, genotyping, and record-keeping to support research objectives and maintain colony health.
    - Created standard operating procedures (SOPs) for in vivo (mouse) inhalation studies on tobacco and e-cigarette products using inEXPOSE inhalation equipment to assess cardiovascular toxicity indicators.
    - Trained 3+ new staff and student trainees in lab and inhalation exposure protocols within four weeks of onboarding.

* 10/2016 - 07/2023: Life Science Research Professional 1
  * Stanford University
  * Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery
  * Duties included:
    - Led multiple in vivo (mouse) projects assessing acute and chronic effects of tobacco and e-cigarette inhalation using inEXPOSE inhalation equipment to gain insights into laryngeal toxicity.
    - Authored and co-authored 9 publications focused on tobacco product-induced laryngeal toxicity.
    - Conducted bioinformatic analysis on NanoString nCounter data from an inflammation panel using R, leading to a publication in Nature Scientific Reports.
    - Collaborated across multiple disciplines, including rhinology (nose) and otology (ear) divisions, contributing to different projects within the department, which led to 2 publications.
    - Utilized various experimental techniques from various disciplines, including molecular biology, histology, immunostaining, microscopy, and digital pathology/image analysis.
    - Developed SOPs to ensure accurate and reproducible results.
    - Trained 10+ new staff, student trainees, and clinical residents in the lab and inhalation exposure protocols within four weeks of onboarding.
