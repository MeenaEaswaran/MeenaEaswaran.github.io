## 🧑‍🔬🥼 Research Associate (part-time)  
**Stanford University 📍 Stanford, California, United States**  
**August 2023 - Present**  

- Employed R to analyze Bulk RNA-sequencing data (differential expression/pathway database enrichment/network analysis) from mouse and in vitro models of laryngeal injury, caused by inhaled tobacco and e-cigarette products, yielding actionable insights for functional validation studies.  
- Conducted functional validation assays on laryngeal tissue samples to evaluate changes in gene expression and protein levels from Bulk-RNA sequencing, enhancing study reliability.  
- Trained 5+ new staff, student trainees, and clinical residents in lab protocols and/or bioinformatic tools within four weeks of onboarding.
