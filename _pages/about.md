ðŸ”¬ Biological Researcher at Stanford University, CA, USA  
ðŸŽ“ Bioinformatician-in-Training at UTHealth Houston, TX, USA      
ðŸ’¡ Biological Data-Driven Problem Solver

Hello! I am a driven scientist with a unique blend of hands-on experimental biology expertise and a growing proficiency in bioinformatics. With over nine years of academic research experience in microbiology, virology, cardiovascular health, and otolaryngology, I bring deep expertise in molecular biology, histology, microscopy, immunostaining, and lab management. My journey has provided me with a strong foundation in experimental design and biological systems, which now complements my growing bioinformatic skill set.

Currently, I am a Researcher in the **[DiRenzo Lab](https://med.stanford.edu/direnzolab/meet-the-team.html)** within the **Otolaryngologyâ€”Head & Neck Surgery (OHNS) Department** at **Stanford University, CA, USA**. My primary focus is on utilizing transcriptomics to investigate the molecular consequences of tobacco products (traditional cigarettes and electronic (e)-cigarettes) on laryngeal health. Initially, I was involved in developing in vivo models to elucidate tobacco product(s)-induced laryngeal pathophysiology, which has since evolved into integrating experimental approaches with computational analysis to elucidate underlying disease mechanisms.

In parallel with my professional work, I am pursuing a **second Masterâ€™s degree in Biomedical Informatics** at the **McWilliams School of Biomedical Informatics** at **UTHealth, Houston**, with concentrations in **bioinformatics** and **health data science**. My academic projects have leveraged R programming to analyze microarray and bulk RNA-seq datasets, with a particular focus on transcriptomics related to tobacco exposure and respiratory health. These efforts complement my professional research, providing a more comprehensive understanding of respiratory health."

I am deeply passionate about bridging the gap between bench research and bioinformatics, bringing a multidisciplinary perspective to tackle complex biological problems and drive advancements in understanding health and disease. As I continue to grow in this field, I am eager to fully embrace bioinformatics, applying innovative approaches to address challenging questions in biology and informatics.
