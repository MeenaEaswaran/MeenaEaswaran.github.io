About Me
======
Hello! I am a passionate scientist transitioning from a wet lab-focused career to the exciting and dynamic field of bioinformatics. With over nine years of academic research experience in microbiology, virology, cardiovascular health, and otolaryngology, I bring deep expertise in molecular biology, histology, microscopy, immunostaining, and lab management. My journey has provided me with a strong foundation in experimental design and biological systems, which now complements my growing bioinformatic skill set.

Currently, I am pursuing a second Master’s degree in **Biomedical Informatics** at **McWilliams School of Biomedical Informatics** at **UTHealth, Houston**, with concentrations in **bioinformatics** and **health data science**. My journey has been focused on leveraging computational tools to analyze high-throughput sequencing data, particularly **microarray** and **bulk RNA-seq datasets**, and performing transcriptomic and pathway analyses to uncover insights into complex disease mechanisms like respiratory health.

I am passionate about bridging the gap between bench research and bioinformatics, bringing a multidisciplinary perspective to tackle complex biological problems and drive advancements in understanding health and disease.

Thank you for visiting my page. Feel free to explore my portfolio to learn more about my work, and let’s connect to discuss opportunities for collaboration!
